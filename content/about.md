Greetings! I am an experienced software engineer with a strong passion for technology.

Originally from Nepal, I've been living in Germany since late 2016, where I earned a Master's degree in Information Engineering, specializing in Intelligent Systems. My continued professional journey in Germany has provided me with valuable experiences, working with diverse teams and engaging in interesting projects.

Over the course of a decade in my professional career, I have honed my skills in several programming languages, including Python, Javascript, Typescript, NodeJS, and PHP. I have a successful history of getting things done and a knack for devising innovative solutions to complex challenges.

I have been leading and mentoring a software engineering team, resulting in outstanding outcomes. With strong communication skills, I effectively collaborate with diverse colleagues and teams, fostering a positive and inclusive work environment. I genuinely appreciate the value of different perspectives and firmly believe in the power of teamwork for achieving success.

My passion lies in creating technology that enhances people's lives. I strongly advocate for making technology accessible to all and promoting knowledge sharing. As a result, I wholeheartedly embrace the open-source software movement and actively engage with the vibrant open-source community.

In my leisure time, I find joy in exploring new places, immersing myself in nature, and contemplating profound concepts. Capturing the beauty of the world through photography and videography is a passion of mine. Additionally, I have a deep affection for science fiction, as it ignites my imagination and fuels my curiosity about the potential of future technologies.
