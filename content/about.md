Hi! I'm Subodh Dahal, an experienced software engineer with a strong passion for technology.

Originally from Nepal, I've been in Germany since 2016, where I earned a Master's in Information Engineering, specializing in Intelligent Systems.

Over a decade, I've become skilled in various programming languages like Python, Javascript, Typescript, NodeJS, and PHP. I have a successful track record in delivering innovative solutions.

I lead and mentor a software engineering team, emphasizing effective communication and teamwork for success. I'm dedicated to making technology accessible and supporting the open-source community.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring nature, photography, and diving into science fiction for inspiration.
