---

Greetings! I am an experienced software engineer with a strong passion for technology. I started my foray into technology in my home country Nepal. I have been living in Germany for the past five years, where I also earned my Master's degree in Information Engineering with a specialization in Intelligent Systems.

Over the course of a decade in my professional career, I have honed my skills in several programming languages, including Javascript, Typescript, NodeJS, Python, and PHP. Recently, I have also been leading and mentoring a dynamic software engineering team to deliver exceptional results.

I have a successful history of getting things done and finding innovative ways to solve problems. I have strong communication skills and work well with people, including mentoring and working with teams and colleagues from different backgrounds. I enjoy working in diverse team environments and embracing new perspectives. I believe that success comes from working together.

I am driven by my love for making tech that betters people's lives. I also firmly believe in the tenets of open-source software.

I like to travel, be in nature, and think about profound ideas in my free time. I also love capturing moments and the world's beauty through photos and videos. I have an immense love for science fiction, which fuels my imagination about the future and what technology can do.
